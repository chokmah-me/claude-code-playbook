# Execute Refactoring Plan

Full implementation workflow with comprehensive validation.

## Prerequisites
- Approved plan from qplan
- Clear understanding of files to modify
- Budget awareness

## Hard Limits
- Max 15 files per session
- All tests must pass before next file
- Stop immediately if TypeScript errors

## Process
1. Initialize REFACTOR_PROGRESS.md
2. Execute file-by-file
3. Validate after each file
4. Commit every 2-4 files
5. Generate UX test scenarios
6. Final verification suite

## Token Cost
~8-12K tokens (varies by scope)

## Usage
Only after qplan approval. This is the most expensive workflow.

See SKILL.md for complete execution protocol.
